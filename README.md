# 4people - Ad-hoc Emergency Communication

Emergency communication app for Android that enables ad-hoc networking when traditional infrastructure fails.

## Konzept (Concept)

This app provides ad-hoc emergency communication capabilities that can be activated with a single click. When activated, the app:

1. **Activates Bluetooth**: Makes the device discoverable and scans for other emergency devices
2. **Scans WiFi Networks**: Continuously scans for emergency WiFi networks with pattern `4people-<id>`
3. **Creates Hotspot**: Attempts to create a WiFi hotspot with emergency naming pattern for automatic detection
4. **Standby Mode**: App is ready for activation by detecting emergency broadcasts from other devices

### Emergency Detection Pattern

All emergency devices use the naming pattern `4people-<unique-id>` for both:
- Bluetooth device names
- WiFi network SSIDs (where supported)

This allows automatic detection of emergency situations by scanning for this pattern.

## Features

- ✓ Local hotspot activation (on supported devices)
- ✓ Foreground service with persistent notification
- ✓ Emergency broadcast signaling
- ✓ WiFi Direct peer-to-peer discovery
- ✓ SMS emergency broadcast to contacts
- ✓ **Mesh network routing** - Multi-hop message forwarding through intermediate devices
- ✓ **Automatic route discovery** - AODV-like protocol for finding paths to distant devices
- ✓ **Trust-based message evaluation** - Assess message trustworthiness based on sender trust level, hop count, and peer verifications
- ✓ **Flashlight Morse code signaling (optional)**
- ✓ **Ultrasound emergency beacon (optional)**
- ✓ **NFC Tap-to-Join** - Quick network joining through device-to-device NFC touch
- ✓ **GPS location sharing** - Automatic GPS coordinate broadcasting to all network participants
- ✓ **Participant location map** - View all participants' locations in the emergency network
- ✓ **Help requests with location** - Send emergency help requests with GPS coordinates
- ✓ **Panic Mode** - Progressive escalation system with confirmation checks, alerts, and emergency contact notification
- ✓ **Emergency Propagation Simulation** - Visual simulation tool to demonstrate message spread through the network

### Emergency Propagation Simulation
The app includes an interactive simulation mode that visualizes how emergency messages spread:
- ✓ Visual map showing people, WiFi networks, and events
- ✓ **9 Predefined Scenarios**: City Center, City, Village × 3 infrastructure failure modes
- ✓ **Verbal Transmission**: Simulates word-of-mouth in critical scenarios
- ✓ **Approaching Behavior**: Informed people actively seek uninformed people

- ✓ Time controls with adjustable speed (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
- ✓ Real-time statistics and coverage metrics
- ✓ Movement simulation with realistic walking patterns
- ✓ See [SIMULATION.md](SIMULATION.md) for detailed documentation

### Panic Mode
Panic Mode provides automatic escalation when user cannot respond:
- ✓ Regular confirmation requests (every 30 seconds)
- ✓ Gentle warning phase (vibration/sound alerts)
- ✓ Massive alert phase (flashlight, alarm, GPS activation, backend notification)
- ✓ Progressive contact notification (intervals double: 3min, 6min, 12min, etc.)
- ✓ Home screen widget for quick activation
- ✓ Configurable warning types and auto-network activation
- ✓ See [PANIC_MODE.md](PANIC_MODE.md) for detailed documentation

### Standby Mode
- ✓ App ready to receive activation broadcasts
- ✓ Background WiFi scanning for emergency patterns (every 30 seconds)
- ✓ Phone call indicator detection (brief incoming calls)
- ✓ **Ultrasound listening for emergency beacons** (continuous passive detection)
- ✓ Automatic or manual activation on emergency detection
- ✓ Low battery consumption
- ✓ Starts automatically on device boot

### NFC Tap-to-Join Feature

The NFC Tap-to-Join feature allows for quick and seamless network joining:

**How it works:**
1. **Person A** has emergency mode activated
2. **Person B** taps their NFC-enabled device against Person A's device
3. Network credentials are automatically exchanged via NFC
4. **Person B** receives a prompt to join the emergency network
5. Upon confirmation, Person B immediately joins the network

**Requirements:**
- Both devices must have NFC hardware
- NFC must be enabled in device settings
- The app must be in the foreground or have been recently used

**Benefits:**
- **Instant network sharing** - No manual configuration needed
- **Secure** - Credentials expire after 1 hour
- **Easy to use** - Simply tap devices together
- **Works offline** - No internet connection required

2. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
3. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
4. Test both positive and negative cases
5. Verify constants, patterns, and cross-component consistency

## Limitations

- WiFi hotspot creation is restricted on Android 8+ and requires special system permissions
- Some manufacturers restrict background Bluetooth scanning
- Location permission is required for WiFi scanning on Android 6+
- Battery consumption increases significantly in active mode

## Emergency Communication Channels

The app uses multiple communication channels that work in different scenarios:

### SMS Emergency Broadcasts
- **Technology**: SMS over cellular voice network
- **Requirements**: Cellular voice network (NOT WiFi or mobile data)
- **Availability**:
  - ✅ Works when mobile data is down (voice network still operational)
  - ✅ Works when internet backbone fails (voice network still operational)
  - ❌ Does NOT work over WiFi networks
  - ❌ Does NOT work when cellular network completely fails
- **Use Case**: Notify emergency contacts who may not have the app installed
- **Configuration**: Enable in Settings and configure emergency contacts

### WiFi-Based Communication
- **Technology**: WiFi scanning, hotspot creation, WiFi Direct
- **Requirements**: Power at WiFi access points, device WiFi capability
- **Availability**:
  - ✅ Works independently of cellular infrastructure
  - ✅ Works when mobile data fails
  - ✅ Works when internet backbone fails
  - ✅ Local propagation even with complete infrastructure failure
  - ⚠️ Limited range (typically 50-100 meters)
- **Use Case**: Ad-hoc networking when traditional infrastructure fails

### Bluetooth Communication
- **Technology**: Bluetooth discovery, advertising, mesh networking
- **Requirements**: Bluetooth enabled on devices
- **Availability**:
  - ✅ Works completely independently of all infrastructure
  - ✅ Works in all failure scenarios
  - ⚠️ Shorter range than WiFi (typically 10-50 meters)
- **Use Case**: Short-range peer-to-peer emergency networking

**Important**: SMS and WiFi are DIFFERENT channels. SMS cannot work over WiFi - it requires cellular network. The simulation now correctly models which communication channels are available in different infrastructure failure scenarios.
